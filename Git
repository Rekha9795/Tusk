      Firstly he invented Linux Trenel
                              ||
                      Meance-> It is an open source and anyone can download the copy make changes and submited but that cannot accept the request from the others
                                because it requirs the contibuters.
GIT: Distributed Version control System.
SCM:Software configuration Management.or Source Code Management.
Repository:It is a place Where we can store all our code.
Previously we are using ->Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
                                      ||
				Meance U had a one mechine(computer) and server. All the versions are stored in server.here the drowback is if the server fails or 
                                the data present in the server can lost.  
Now we are using        ->Distributed Version control System(DVCS)
					||
				Meance In each mechine it creates a local repo (distributed) and we can update our version ,then when we are getting our internet acces 
                                   at that time we can push our local to the remote repo.
Trunk Based Development->If we want to do 2 versions on the same project, then we have to create branch.
				Ex:If an angular project contains version of 4.7 and at the same time we want to do it on the 5.0 .
				    so, here it contains a master branch with version 4.7  and we are doing some modifications and commiting.
				    After that if we want to cange it the 5.0 then we have to crate the new branch.If the newly created branch is working properly 
					then we an murge it to the master branch.
